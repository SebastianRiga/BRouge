## Prelude

The goal of this project is to create a classic rougelike inspired game
in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Roadmap

The first step is to get familiar with the [bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/) and create
the scaffolding:

* Create a grid with addressable tiles
* Generate a random map and render it
* Integrate collision
* Implement player and movement
